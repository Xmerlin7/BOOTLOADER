# Bootloader Project

## Introduction

The Bootloader Project is a lightweight and efficient bootloader designed for embedded systems and microcontrollers. It simplifies the process of loading and initializing operating systems, providing features like memory management, device initialization, and firmware loading.

## Features

- **Flexible Bootloading**: Supports multiple boot sources like serial communication, USB, and SPI flash.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Easily configurable through a user-friendly `config.h` file.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive mechanism to handle various failure scenarios.
- **Modular Design**: Allows for easy extension and customization.
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Optimized for minimal memory usage, ideal for resource-constrained systems.

## Getting Started

To use the Bootloader Project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bootloader-project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bootloader-project`
3. Configure the bootloader by editing `config.h`.
4. Build the bootloader.
5. Flash the compiled binary to your device.
6. Connect to the bootloader interface (e.g., serial terminal).
7. Follow instructions to load and execute firmware images.

## Usage

### `bootloader_init()`

Initializes the bootloader and performs necessary setup procedures.

### `bootloader_load_firmware(const char *firmware_path)`

Loads and executes firmware specified by the provided path.

### `bootloader_erase_flash()`

Erases flash memory to prepare for firmware loading.

### `bootloader_check_for_update()`

Checks for a newer version of the bootloader and prompts the user for an update if available.

### `bootloader_verify_firmware(const char *firmware_path)`

Verifies the integrity of the firmware image before loading.

### `bootloader_get_version()`

Returns the version information of the bootloader.
